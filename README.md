little skript to get a little bit of that "Random Button" back.

It is just an really basic Console Skrikt to "random" your next hero.

There is a little Filter and an Bonus option implemented.

Filter:
You can decide which positions you want to play. The filters are connect with OR, so it wont find a hero with all of your inputs.

Bonus:
I marked some of my favorite heros as bonus heros, which are more likely to get choosen.
This works by adding bonus heros twice to the pile of possible heros (after the filter).

Disclamer, Iam a 2k Scrub and the next big patch is pretty close (I hope so). 
So if you are not happy with my decisions about which hero is playing which position,
you can easily change all of the parameters in the bool filter[][].



PURE RANDOM: just press 2 at the first question.
